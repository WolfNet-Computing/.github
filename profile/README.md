# WolfNet Computing
## About us...
WolfNet Computing is a non-profit organisation (not a charity) dedicated to providing quality for free and computer education to all. Created by [John Wolfe](https://github.com/DarkestSoul1992) in the UK in 2019 and managed by him since, we strive to put maximum effort into everything we design. We mostly design teaching and electrical engineering tools. (The first WolfNet Computing project was a processor!) We don't create anything custom or to order but all our projects (designs and code) are released under an open source licence (If none fit, we will make one.) with customisation instructions (where possible) for ease of use, modification and deployment.
## We need volunteers!
We are currently looking for designers, programmers and more to volunteer and to either contribute to, or help manage our open-source projects. Visit our [website](https://wolfnet-computing.com) to apply and register.
