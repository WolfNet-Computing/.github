# WolfNet Computing C.I.C. 
## About us...  [WolfNet Computing C.I.C.](https://www.wolfnet-computing.com) is a Community Interest Company that is based around electrical engineering and programming. We are dedicated to providing quality for free and computer related education to all. It was created by [John Wolfe](https://github.com/DarkestSoul1992) in the UK in 2019 and has been managed by both [Jade Wolfe](https://github.com/J4D3-1990) and himself, since 2023 and was incorporated into a Community Interest Company in 2024. We strive to put maximum effort into everything we design and we don't create things as "Made-To-Order" products. Instead, all of our projects (Schematics, PCB Layouts and Code) are released under an open-source licence with customisation instructions (wherever possible) to ease usage, modification and deployment.
<!-- ## We need volunteers!  
We are currently looking for designers, programmers and more to volunteer and to either contribute to, or help with managing our open-source projects. Visit our [website](https://wolfnet-computing.com) to apply and register.  -->
