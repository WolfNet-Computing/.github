# WolfNet Computing

## About us...
WolfNet Computing is a non-profit organisation dedicated to providing quality for free and computer education to all. Created and managed by [John Wolfe](https://github.com/TheAlmostGenius) in the UK in 2019, we strive to put 100% effort into everything we design. We mostly design teaching and EE tools.
## We need you!
We are currently looking for designers and programmers to join in our open-source projects. Join our volunteer discussion to apply.
